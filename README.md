For this project I am creating data visualization with Tableau for bike sharing program in New York City. The idea is to analyze the data, see the mechanics of the business and figure out how the bike share business actually works in NYC. This is the first step of expanding the idea to other cities. With a strong and clear story, backed-up by data we can create a proposal on how the business could work in other cities as well.

The Tableau story of the NYC CitiBike can be found in the following link: [NewYorkCitibike-Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/namrata.s/viz/NewYork_Citibike_Challenge/NewYorkCitibike-Story)

# Results
In NYC, there were over 2.3M trips that occurred during the month of August where mainly the starting location is from the Downtown area and that Men were the primary user of this program.

This graphing of number of trips by duration show that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an hour in length. More specifically, most trips are under a half-hour in length, with a swift dropoff in number of rides over an hour in length.

## Checkout times by Gender :

Male riders are the primary user of the bike share program making up 65% of the population, with the remaining being 25% female and 10% unknown.

## Trips by Weekday per hour :

Most of the rides during the weekdays (M-F) occur during commuting hours of 8-9a and 5-7pm. It can be assumed that the bike sharing program is the preferred method for commuting to and from work.

## Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) :

Male riders are more inclined to use the bike sharing program to commute to and from work, as well as during the weekend.

The most popular places for Citibike customers to end their journeys in New York City are the same as starting locations.

# Summary
Once I have completed my visualizations in tableau the one thing that stood out to me was Thursday is the most popular day to take a bike ride. It would be a good idea for our customer to start the bikeshare business in a different city because whether people are biking to get to work or just doing it for fun there are lots of users/ customers who will buy in. Although I think we have enough evidence to convince our customer to do this even if we are only looking at one month, there are some other visulizations that can further back this claim. If we were to look at the colder months in the city to see how many riders we have in November/December so that the customer can prepare for those months, One other visualization I would like to make is the average distance between customers home location and the bike renting location which would allow the customer to adjust for potential biker locations.
